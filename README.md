# work-day-scheduler

The purpose of this project was to create a simple planner that a user could use for the working hours of the day. They would be able to put in the tasks/events and save it to the planner. If this page was refreshed, the data should be stored and still apear on the page.

I was motivated to create a useful and working tool that many could take advantage of. I was disappointed that I couldn't get the local storage to full execute and I'm not sure why. 

I learned a lot on how to implement and execute Bootstrap, moment and jquery libraries. Additionally I was able to understand javascript better and piece all the functionalities together.

The following is a photo of my Work Day Scheduler
